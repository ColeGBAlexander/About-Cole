<p>Hi, my name is Cole I was born in Espanola, had terrible allergies as a kid and still sometimes do!</p>
<p>However, that doesn't stop me from going out into the forest & enjoying nature.</p>

<P>Thanks to some help form antihistamines, such as flownase - I can more easily be out in the places I love.</P>
