<p>Hi, my name is Cole, I get bad allegrgies, sort of like a cold!</p>
<p>However, that doesn't stop me from going out into the forest & enjoying nature.</p>
<P>Thanks to some help form antihistamines, such as flownase - I can more easily be out in the places I love.</P>

<p>I'm a huge fan of <u>COLE</u> Hamles, who is a MLB player who is a pitcher for the Chicago cubs!</p>
<p>I'm also a fan of NSACAR, my favorite driver is <u>COLE</u> Custer. He races for Haas Racing</p>
